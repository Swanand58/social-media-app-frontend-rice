Note. When i am testing my application on surge when i follow a new user the post does not load up as it does not refresh by itself which was working on the localhost. even if i am emptying a state after i am done updating my headline for example, it works fine on local host but is not working on surge.


if you are not able to load surge url please try in incognito mode

For Third Party Auth I went to office hours anc checked with the professor and did everything what he told but still it is not working for me...You can check the code. Thanks!
